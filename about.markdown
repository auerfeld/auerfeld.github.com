London-based comms and campaigns (and... and...) person. These days most of my work is done at [Blueprint for Free Speech](https://blueprintforfreespeech.net), where we're running a bunch of very interesting, often Europe-based, projects.

My primary professional interest is in freedom of expression and the limits thereof. Current focuses include whistleblowing, anti-SLAPP strategies and hacktivism. 

Every so often - less so recently - my articles appear in newspapers, magazines and academic journals. I still speak at conferences from time to time. 

The best way to get in touch with me is via email at the address below. Other email addresses are active, but I check them more sporadically.
